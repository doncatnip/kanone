* docs for validators
* get rid of pre_validate, post_validate, fieldset
  - using pre and post_validate is exactly the same as using &
  - defining a Schema with a fieldset is the same as using
    mySchema = Schema( 'field1', Validator(), 'field2', Validator())
* check how much core functionality could be ported to c/c++ without
  sacrifiyng an easy API - mainly to make composed Validators faster
  bottleneck atm is chaining alot with nested And/Or
* unit tests
